         <h3>Chicken</h3>
         <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.
          Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
          The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one
          Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.
          Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak</p>

          <h3>Beef</h3>
          <p>Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus).
            It is categorized as red meat — a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish.
            Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers.
            Processed beef products include corned beef, beef jerky, and sausages.
            Fresh, lean beef is rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc. Therefore, moderate intake of beef can be recommended as part of a healthy diet (1Trusted Source).
            This article tells you everything you need to know about beef.Meat — such as beef — is mainly composed of protein.
            The protein content of lean, cooked beef is about 26–27% (2Trusted Source).
            Animal protein is usually of high quality, containing all nine essential amino acids needed for the growth and maintenance of your body (3Trusted Source).
            As the building blocks of proteins, amino acids are very important from a health perspective. Their composition in proteins varies widely, depending on the dietary source.
            Meat is one of the most complete dietary sources of protein, its amino acid profile being almost identical to that of your own muscles.
            For this reason, eating meat — or other sources of animal protein — may be of particular benefit after surgery and for recovering athletes. In combination with strength exercise, it also helps maintain and build muscle mass (3Trusted Source).

          <h3>Sushi</h3>
          <p>A dish known as narezushi , stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The process can be traced back to the early domestication of rice in the neolithic cultures of China,other.
            When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the next months, and Narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. 
            The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated terminal-form conjugation,sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui "to be sour"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.
            Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. </p>
